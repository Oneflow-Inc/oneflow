def bernoulli(input, *, generator=None, out=None):
    r"""This operator returns a Tensor with binaray random numbers (0 / 1) from a Bernoulli distribution.

    Args:
        input(Tensor) - the input tensor of probability values for the Bernoulli distribution
        generator: (optional) – a pseudorandom number generator for sampling
        out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`. Input can be of any shape
        - Output: :math:`(*)`. Output is of the same shape as input

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import oneflow as flow
