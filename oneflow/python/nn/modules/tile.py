def tile_op(x, sizes):
    r"""The interface is consistent with PyTorch.

    This operator repeat the input tensor to a larger size along the specified dimensions.

    Args:
        x (oneflow.Tensor): The input Tensor.
        size (Sequence[int]): The number of times to repeat this tensor along each dimension

    .. note::
        This function is similar to NumPyâ€™s tile function.

    Returns:
        oneflow.Tensor: The result Tensor.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow.experimental as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> flow.enable_eager_execution()

        >>> x = np.array([1, 2]).astype(np.int32)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(x, dtype=flow.int32)
        >>> out = input.tile(sizes=(2,))
        >>> out
        tensor([1, 2, 1, 2], dtype=oneflow.int32)

        >>> x = np.random.randn(5, 2, 1)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(x)
        >>> out = input.tile(sizes=(3, 4))
        >>> out.size()
        flow.Size([5, 6, 4])
