    We can set one dimension in `shape` as `-1`, the operator will infer the complete shape.

    Args:
        x: A Tensor.
        shape: Shape of the output tensor.
    Returns:
        A Tensor has the same type as `x`.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import oneflow.experimental as flow
        >>> flow.enable_eager_execution()
