    """This operator expand the input tensor to a larger size.

    Passing -1 as the size for a dimension means not changing the size of that dimension.

    Tensor can be also expanded to a larger number of dimensions and the new ones will be appended at the front.

    For the new dimensions, the size cannot be set to -1.

    Args:
        x (oneflow.Tensor): The input Tensor.
        *sizes  (flow.Size or int): The desired expanded size.

    Returns:
        oneflow.Tensor: The result Tensor.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> x = np.array([[[[0, 1]],
        ...               [[2, 3]],
