    """Applies the element-wise function:

    .. math::
        PReLU(x) = \max(0,x) + a * \min(0,x)

    Here :math:`a` is a learnable parameter. When called without arguments, `nn.PReLU()` uses a single
    parameter :math:`a` across all input channels. If called with `nn.PReLU(nChannels)`,
    a separate :math:`a` is used for each input channel.


    .. note::
        weight decay should not be used when learning :math:`a` for good performance.

    .. note::
        Channel dim is the 2nd dim of input. When input has dims < 2, then there is
        no channel dim and the number of channels = 1.

    Args:
        num_parameters (int): number of :math:`a` to learn.
            Although it takes an int as input, there is only two values are legitimate:
            1, or the number of channels at input. Default: 1
        init (float): the initial value of :math:`a`. Default: 0.25

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where `*` means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Output: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input

    Attr:
        - weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of shape (:attr:`num_parameters`).
