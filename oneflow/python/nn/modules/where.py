    If the element in condition is larger than 0,

        The tensors :attr:`condition`, :attr:`x`, :attr:`y` must be broadcastable.

        condition (IntTensor): When 1 (nonzero), yield x, otherwise yield y
        x (Tensor or Scalar): value (if :attr:x is a scalar) or values selected at indices
