// This header file contains the macro definitions for thread safety
// annotations that allow the developers to document the locking policies
// of their multi-threaded code. The annotations can also help program
// analysis tools to identify potential thread safety issues.
//
// The primary documentation on these annotations is external:
// http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html
//
// The annotations are implemented using compiler attributes.
// Using the macros defined here instead of the raw attributes allows
// for portability and future compatibility.
//
// When referring to mutexes in the arguments of the attributes, you should
// use variable names or more complex expressions (e.g. my_object->mutex_)
// that evaluate to a concrete mutex object whenever possible. If the mutex
// you want to refer to is not in scope, you may use a member pointer
// (e.g. &MyClass::mutex_) to refer to a mutex in some (unknown) object.

// Document if a shared variable/field needs to be protected by a mutex.
// GUARDED_BY allows the user to specify a particular mutex that should be
// held when accessing the annotated variable.  GUARDED_VAR indicates that
// a shared variable is guarded by some unspecified mutex, for use in rare
// cases where a valid mutex expression cannot be specified.

// by a mutex when dereferencing the pointer.  PT_GUARDED_VAR is analogous to
// GUARDED_VAR.   Note that a pointer variable to a shared memory location
// could itself be a shared variable. For example, if a shared global pointer
// q, which is guarded by mu1, points to a shared memory location that is
// guarded by mu2, q should be annotated as follows:
