def memory_stats(device: int = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    r"""Returns a dictionary of CUDA memory allocator statistics for a
    given device.

    The return value of this function is a dictionary of statistics, each of
    which is a non-negative integer.

    Core statistics:

    - ``"allocated.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"allocated_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of allocated memory.
    - ``"segment.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of reserved segments from ``cudaMalloc()``.
    - ``"reserved_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of reserved memory.
    - ``"active.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of active memory blocks.
    - ``"active_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of active memory.
    - ``"inactive_split.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of inactive, non-releasable memory blocks.
    - ``"inactive_split_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of inactive, non-releasable memory.

    For these core statistics, values are broken down as follows.

    Pool type:

    - ``all``: combined statistics across all memory pools.
    - ``large_pool``: statistics for the large allocation pool
      (as of October 2019, for size >= 1MB allocations).
    - ``small_pool``: statistics for the small allocation pool
      (as of October 2019, for size < 1MB allocations).

    Metric type:

    - ``current``: current value of this metric.
    - ``peak``: maximum value of this metric.
    - ``allocated``: historical total increase in this metric.
    - ``freed``: historical total decrease in this metric.

    In addition to the core statistics, we also provide some simple event
    counters:

    - ``"num_alloc_retries"``: number of failed ``cudaMalloc`` calls that
      result in a cache flush and retry.
    - ``"num_ooms"``: number of out-of-memory errors thrown.

    The caching allocator can be configured via ENV to not split blocks larger than a
    defined size (see Memory Management section of the Cuda Semantics documentation).
    This helps avoid memory fragmentation but may have a performance
    penalty. Additional outputs to assist with tuning and evaluating impact:

    - ``"max_split_size"``: blocks above this size will not be split.
    - ``"oversize_allocations.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of over-size allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"oversize_segments.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of over-size reserved segments from ``cudaMalloc()``.

    Args:
        device (torch.device or int, optional): selected device. Returns
            statistics for the current device, given by :func:`~torch.cuda.current_device`,
            if :attr:`device` is ``None`` (default).

    .. note::
        See :ref:`cuda-memory-management` for more details about GPU memory
        management.

    .. note::
        With :ref:`backend:cudaMallocAsync<cuda-memory-envvars>`, some stats are not
        meaningful, and are always reported as zero.
