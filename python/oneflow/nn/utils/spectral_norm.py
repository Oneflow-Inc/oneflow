        # NB: If `do_power_iteration` is set, the `u` and `v` vectors are
        #     updated in power iteration **in-place**. This is very important
        #     because in `DataParallel` forward, the vectors (being buffers) are
        #     broadcast from the parallelized module to each module replica,
        #     which is a new module object created on the fly. And each replica
        #     runs its own spectral norm power iteration. So simply assigning
        #     the updated vectors to the module this function runs on will cause
        #     the update to be lost forever. And the next time the parallelized
        #     module is replicated, the same randomly initialized vectors are
        #     broadcast and used!
        #
        #     Therefore, to make the change propagate back, we rely on two
        #     important behaviors (also enforced via tests):
        #       1. `DataParallel` doesn't clone storage if the broadcast tensor
        #          is already on correct device; and it makes sure that the
        #          parallelized module is already on `device[0]`.
        #       2. If the out tensor in `out=` kwarg has correct shape, it will
        #          just fill in the values.
        #     Therefore, since the same power iteration is performed on all
        #     devices, simply updating the tensors in-place will make sure that
        #     the module replica on `device[0]` will update the _u vector on the
        #     parallized module (by shared storage).
        #
        #    However, after we update `u` and `v` in-place, we need to **clone**
        #    them before using them to normalize the weight. This is to support
        #    backproping through two forward passes, e.g., the common pattern in
        #    GAN training: loss = D(real) - D(fake). Otherwise, engine will
        #    complain that variables needed to do backward for the first forward
        #    (i.e., the `u` and `v` vectors) are changed in the second forward.

    Spectral normalization stabilizes the training of discriminators (critics)
    in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by rescaling the weight tensor
    with spectral norm :math:`\sigma` of the weight matrix calculated using power
    iteration method. If the dimension of the weight tensor is greater than 2,
    it is reshaped to 2D in power iteration method to get spectral norm.
    This is implemented via a hook that calculates spectral norm and rescales
    weight before every :meth:`~Module.forward` call.
