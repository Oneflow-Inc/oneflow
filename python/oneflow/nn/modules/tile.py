    """The interface is consistent with PyTorch.
    The documentation is referenced from:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.tile.html

    Constructs a tensor by repeating the elements of ``input``.  The ``reps`` argument specifies the number
    of repetitions in each dimension.

    If ``reps`` specifies fewer dimensions than ``input`` has, then ones are prepended to ``reps`` until
    all dimensions are specified.  For example, if ``input`` has shape (8, 6, 4, 2) and ``reps`` is (2, 2),
    then ``reps`` is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2).

    Analogously, if ``input`` has fewer dimensions than ``reps`` specifies, then ``input`` is treated as
    if it were unsqueezed at dimension zero until it has as many dimensions as ``reps`` specifies.
    For example, if ``input`` has shape (4, 2) and ``reps`` is (3, 3, 2, 2), then ``input`` is treated as
    if it had the shape (1, 1, 4, 2).

    .. note::
        This function is similar to NumPyâ€™s tile function.

    Args:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): the tensor whose elements to repeat.
        reps (tuple): the number of repetitions per dimension.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        
        >>> x = np.array([1, 2]).astype(np.int32)
        >>> input = flow.tensor(x, dtype=flow.int32)
        >>> out = input.tile(reps=(2,))
        >>> out
        tensor([1, 2, 1, 2], dtype=oneflow.int32)

        >>> x = np.random.randn(5, 2, 1)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(x)
        >>> out = input.tile(reps=(3, 4))
        >>> out.size()
        oneflow.Size([5, 6, 4])

    diff = len(input_shape) - len(reps)

        shape = [1 for _ in range(diff)]
