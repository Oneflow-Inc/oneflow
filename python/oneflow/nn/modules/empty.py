    Returns a tensor filled with uninitialized data.
    The shape of the tensor is defined by the variable argument ``size``.

    Args:
        size (int... or oneflow.Size): Defining the shape of the output tensor.
          Can be a variable number of arguments or a collection like a list or tuple or oneflow.Size.
        dtype (flow.dtype, optional): The desired data type of returned tensor. Default: ``flow.float32``.
        device (oneflow.device, optional): The desired device of returned local tensor. If None, uses the
          current device.
        placement (flow.placement, optional): The desired device of returned global tensor. If None, will
          construct local tensor.
        sbp (flow.sbp or List[flow.sbp], optional): The desired sbp of returned global tensor.
        requires_grad (bool, optional): If autograd should record operations on the returned tensor. Default: False.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> y = flow.empty(4, 5)  # construct local empty tensor
        >>> y.shape
        oneflow.Size([4, 5])
        >>> y.is_global
        False
        >>> placement = flow.placement("cpu", ranks=[0])
        >>> y = flow.empty(4, 5, placement=placement, sbp=flow.sbp.broadcast)  # construct consistent empty tensor
        >>> y.is_global
        True
