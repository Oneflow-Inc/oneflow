    """Concatenates a sequence of tensors along a new dimension.
    The returned tensor shares the same underlying data with input tensors.

    A :attr:`dim` value within the range `[-input.ndimension() - 1, input.ndimension() + 1]`
    can be used. Negative :attr:`dim` will correspond to :meth:`stack`
    applied at :attr:`dim` = ``dim + input.ndimension() + 1``.

    Args:
        inputs (List[oneflow.Tensor]): the list of input tensors. Each tensor should have the same shape.
        dim (int): the index at which to insert the concatenated dimension.

    Returns:
