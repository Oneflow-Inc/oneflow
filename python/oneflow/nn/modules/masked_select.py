    Returns a new 1-D tensor which indexes the input tensor according to the boolean mask mask which is a BoolTensor(In oneFlow BoolTensor is replaced by Int8Tensor).

    The shapes of the mask tensor and the input tensor donâ€™t need to match, but they must be broadcastable.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor.
        mask (Tensor): the tensor containing the binary mask to index with

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        
        >>> input = flow.tensor(np.array([[-0.4620, 0.3139], [0.3898, -0.7197], [0.0478, -0.1657]]), dtype=flow.float32)
