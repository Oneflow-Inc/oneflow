    Performs a batch matrix-matrix product of matrices stored in input and mat2.

    `input` and `mat2` must be 3-D tensors each containing the same number of matrices.

    If input is a (b x n x m) tensor, mat2 is a (b x m x p) tensor, out will be a (b x n x p) tensor.

        input(oneflow.Tensor):  the first batch of matrices to be multiplied
        mat2(oneflow.Tensor): the second batch of matrices to be multiplied
