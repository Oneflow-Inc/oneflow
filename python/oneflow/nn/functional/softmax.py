    r"""Applies a softmax function.
    Softmax is defined as:
    :math:`\text{Softmax}(x_{i}) = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j \exp(x_j)}`
    It is applied to all slices along dim, and will re-scale them so that the elements
    lie in the range `[0, 1]` and sum to 1.

    See :class:`~oneflow.nn.Softmax` for more details.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): input
        dim (int): A dimension along which softmax will be computed.
        dtype (:class:`oneflow.dtype`, optional): the desired data type of returned tensor.
            If specified, the input tensor is casted to :attr:`dtype` before the operation
            is performed. This is useful for preventing data type overflows. Default: None.

    .. note::
        This function doesn't work directly with NLLLoss,
        which expects the Log to be computed between the Softmax and itself.
        Use log_softmax instead (it's faster and has better numerical properties).
