    The documentation is referenced from:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/nn/functional.html#gumbel_softmax.

    Samples from the Gumbel-Softmax distribution (`Link 1`_  `Link 2`_) and optionally discretizes.

    Args:
      logits: `[..., num_features]` unnormalized log probabilities
      tau: non-negative scalar temperature
      hard: if ``True``, the returned samples will be discretized as one-hot vectors,
            but will be differentiated as if it is the soft sample in autograd
      dim (int): A dimension along which softmax will be computed. Default: -1.

    Returns:
      Sampled tensor of same shape as `logits` from the Gumbel-Softmax distribution.
      If ``hard=True``, the returned samples will be one-hot, otherwise they will
      be probability distributions that sum to 1 across `dim`.

    .. note::
      This function is here for legacy reasons, may be removed from nn.Functional in the future.

    .. note::
      The main trick for `hard` is to do  `y_hard - y_soft.detach() + y_soft`

      It achieves two things:
      - makes the output value exactly one-hot
      (since we add then subtract y_soft value)
      - makes the gradient equal to y_soft gradient
      (since we strip all other gradients)

    Examples::

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import oneflow.nn.functional as F
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> logits = flow.tensor(np.random.rand(3, 3))
        >>> # Sample soft categorical using reparametrization trick:
        >>> F.gumbel_softmax(logits, tau=1, hard=False)
        >>> # Sample hard categorical using "Straight-through" trick:
        >>> F.gumbel_softmax(logits, tau=1, hard=True)
