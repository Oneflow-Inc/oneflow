    Applies a linear transformation to the incoming data: :math:`y = xA^T + b`.

    Args:
        input: :math:`(N, *, in\_features)` N is the batch size, `*` means any number of additional dimensions
        weight: :math:`(out\_features, in\_features)`
        bias: :math:`(out\_features)`
    
    Returns:
        output: :math:`(N, *, out\_features)`

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import oneflow as flow

        >>> input = flow.tensor(np.random.randn(128, 20))
        >>> weight = flow.tensor(np.random.randn(30, 20))
        >>> output = flow.nn.functional.linear(input, weight)
        >>> output.size()
        oneflow.Size([128, 30])
