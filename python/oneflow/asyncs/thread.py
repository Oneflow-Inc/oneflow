    r"""Context-manager to pick worker thread.
    By default, all opkernels are excuted/launched in worker thread 0. Within this context, opkernels can be excuted/launched in the worker thread indicated by `thread_global_id`. 
    This context manager is thread local; it will not affect ops in other threads.
    Also functions as a decorator. (Make sure to instantiate with parenthesis.)

    Args:
        thread_global_id: a integer in range [0, 3) for communication across ranks.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> with flow.async.thread(2):
        ...     print(flow.ones(2, 2))
        ...
        tensor([[1., 1.],
                [1., 1.]], dtype=oneflow.float32)
        >>> @flow.async.thread(3)
        ... def ones_in_other_thread():
        ...     return flow.ones(2, 2)
        ...
        >>> print(ones_in_other_thread())
        tensor([[1., 1.],
                [1., 1.]], dtype=oneflow.float32)
