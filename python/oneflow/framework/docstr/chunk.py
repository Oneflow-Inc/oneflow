    """chunk(input, chunks, dim)
    Splits a tensor into a specific number of chunks. Each chunk is a view of the input tensor. Last chunk will be bigger if the tensor size along the given dimension dim is not divisible by chunks.

    Args:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): The tensor to split.
        chunks (int): Number of chunks to return.
        dim (int): Dimension along which to split the tensor.

    Returns:
        List of Tensors.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
               
        >>> np_arr = np.random.randn(5, 3, 6, 9).astype(np.float32)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(np_arr)
        >>> of_out = []
        >>> of_out = flow.chunk(input, chunks=3, dim=2)
        >>> chunks = 3
        >>> of_out_shape = []
        >>> for i in range(0, chunks):
        ...     of_out_shape.append(of_out[i].numpy().shape)
        >>> of_out_shape
        [(5, 3, 2, 9), (5, 3, 2, 9), (5, 3, 2, 9)]

        >>> np_arr = np.random.randn(5, 3, 6, 9).astype(np.float32)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(np_arr)
        >>> of_out = []
        >>> of_out = flow.chunk(input, chunks=4, dim=3)
        >>> chunks = 4
        >>> of_out_shape = []
        >>> for i in range(0, chunks):
        ...     of_out_shape.append(of_out[i].numpy().shape)
        >>> of_out_shape
