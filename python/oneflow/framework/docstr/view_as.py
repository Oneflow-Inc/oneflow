    view_as(x, other) -> Tensor
    This function is equivalent to torchâ€™s view_as function.  

    View this tensor as the same size as :attr:`other`.
    ``self.view_as(other)`` is equivalent to ``self.view(other.size())``.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): Return x's view.
        other (Tensor): The result tensor has the same size as :attr:`other`.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> import oneflow as flow
               
        >>> x = flow.tensor(range(12)).reshape(3,4)
        >>> y = flow.tensor(range(12)).reshape(2,6)
        >>> flow.view_as(x, y)
        tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
                [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
