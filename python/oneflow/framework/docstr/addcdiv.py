    addcdiv(input, tensor1, tensor2, *, value=1) -> Tensor

    This function is equivalent to PyTorchâ€™s addcdiv function. 
    The documentation is referenced from: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.10/generated/torch.addcdiv.html.
    
    Performs the element-wise division of :attr:`tensor1` by :attr:`tensor2`,
    multiply the result by the scalar :attr:`value` and add it to :attr:`input`.

    .. math::
        \text{out}_i = \text{input}_i + \text{value} \times \frac{\text{tensor1}_i}{\text{tensor2}_i}


    The shapes of :attr:`input`, :attr:`tensor1`, and :attr:`tensor2` must be
    `broadcastable`.

    For inputs of type `FloatTensor` or `DoubleTensor`, :attr:`value` must be
    a real number, otherwise an integer.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the tensor to be added
        tensor1 (Tensor): the numerator tensor
        tensor2 (Tensor): the denominator tensor

    Keyword args:
        value (Number, optional): multiplier for :math:`\text{{tensor1}} / \text{{tensor2}}`

    Example::

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> input = flow.tensor([ 0.3810,  1.2774, -0.2972, -0.3719])
        >>> tensor1 = flow.tensor([0.8032,  0.2930, -0.8113, -0.2308])
        >>> tensor2 = flow.tensor([[0.5], [1]])
        >>> output = flow.addcdiv(input, tensor1, tensor2)
        >>> output.shape
        oneflow.Size([2, 4])
    """,
