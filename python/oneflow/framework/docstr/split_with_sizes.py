    split_with_sizes(x, split_sizes, dim) -> TensorTuple

    This function is equivalent to torchâ€™s split_with_sizes function.

    `x` will be split into `len(split_sizes)` chunks
    with sizes in `dim` according to `split_sizes`.

    Args:
        x: tensor to split.
        split_sizes: list of sizes for each chunk.
        dim: dimension along which to split the tensor.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> import oneflow as flow
               
        >>> a = flow.arange(10).reshape(5,2)
        >>> flow.split_with_sizes(a, [1,4])
        (tensor([[0, 1]], dtype=oneflow.int64), tensor([[2, 3],
                [4, 5],
                [6, 7],
                [8, 9]], dtype=oneflow.int64))

    """,
