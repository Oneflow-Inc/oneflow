    """This function is equivalent to PyTorchâ€™s amin function. 
    The documentation is referenced from: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.amin.html.
    Returns the minimum value of each slice of the `input` tensor in the given dimension(s) `dim`.
    If `keepdim` is `True`, the output tensor is of the same size as `input` except in the dimension(s) `dim` where it is of size 1. Otherwise, `dim` is squeezed (see :func:`oneflow.squeeze`), resulting in the output tensor having 1 (or `len(dim)`) fewer dimension(s).
    
    Args:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): the input Tensor.
        dim (int or tuple of python:ints): the dimension or dimensions to reduce. 
        keepdim (bool): whether the output tensor has `dim` retained or not.
    
    Returns:
        oneflow.Tensor: Maximum of the input tensor
    
    Example:
    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> a = flow.randn(4, 4)
        >>> a

                [ 0.2688,  0.7676, -0.1927, -0.8397],
                [-0.0454,  0.5621,  0.1304, -1.2015]], dtype=oneflow.float32)
        >>> flow.amin(a, 1)
