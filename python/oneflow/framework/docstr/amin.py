    amin(input, dim, keepdim=False) -> Tensor  
    
    Returns the minimum value of each slice of the `input` tensor in the given dimension(s) `dim`.

    If `keepdim` is `True`, the output tensor is of the same size as `input` except in the dimension(s) `dim` where it is of size 1. Otherwise, `dim` is squeezed (see :func:`oneflow.squeeze`), resulting in the output tensor having 1 (or `len(dim)`) fewer dimension(s).
    
    This function is equivalent to PyTorchâ€™s amin function. 
    The documentation is referenced from: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.10/generated/torch.amin.html.

    Parameters:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): the input Tensor.
        dim (int, Tuple[int]): the dimension or dimensions to reduce. 
        keepdim (bool): whether the output tensor has `dim` retained or not.
    
    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
               
        >>> x = flow.tensor([[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]])
        >>> flow.amin(x, 1)
        tensor([[0, 1],
                [4, 5]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.amin(x, 0)
        tensor([[0, 1],
                [2, 3]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.amin(x)
        tensor(0, dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.amin(x, 0, True)
        tensor([[[0, 1],
                 [2, 3]]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
    """,
