oneflow.device.__doc__ = r"""
    A :class:`oneflow.device` is an object representing the device on which a :class:`oneflow.Tensor` is or will be allocated.

    The documentation is referenced from:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/1.10/tensor_attributes.html#torch.torch.device.
    
    The :class:`oneflow.device` contains a device type ('cpu' or 'cuda') and optional device ordinal for the device type. If the 
    device ordinal is not present, this object will always represent the current device for the device type.

    A :class:`oneflow.device`â€™s device can be accessed via the Tensor.device property.

    A :class:`oneflow.device` can be constructed via a string or via a string and device ordinal

    Via a string:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> flow.device('cuda:0')
        device(type='cuda', index=0)

        >>> flow.device('cpu')
        device(type='cpu', index=0)

        >>> flow.device('cuda')  # current cuda device
        device(type='cuda', index=0)
    
    Via a string and device ordinal:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> flow.device('cuda', 0)
        device(type='cuda', index=0)

        >>> flow.device('cpu', 0)
        device(type='cpu', index=0)
    
    Note:
        The :class:`oneflow.device` argument in functions can generally be substituted with a string. This allows for fast prototyping of code.
        
        .. code-block:: python

            >>> import oneflow as flow
            >>> # Example of a function that takes in a oneflow.device
            >>> cuda0 = flow.device('cuda:0')
            >>> x = flow.randn(2,3, device=cuda0)
        
        .. code-block:: python

            >>> # You can substitute the flow.device with a string
            >>> x = flow.randn(2,3, device='cuda:0')

oneflow.placement.__doc__ = r"""
    A ``oneflow.placement`` is an object representing the device group on which a :class:`oneflow.Tensor` is or will be allocated. The ``oneflow.placement`` contains a device type ('cpu' or 'cuda') and corresponding device sequence.
    
    A :class:`oneflow.Tensor`'s placement can be accessed via the Tensor.placement property.
    
    A oneflow.placement can be constructed in several ways:
    
    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        
        >>> p = flow.placement(type="cuda", ranks=[0, 1, 2, 3])

        >>> p
        oneflow.placement(type="cuda", ranks=[[0, 1], [2, 3]])
        
    """

reset_docstr(
    oneflow.placement.all,
    r"""
    oneflow.placement.all(device_type) -> oneflow.placement

    Returns a placement that contains all available devices.

    Args:
        device_type (str): cuda or cpu

    For examples:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Runs on 4 ranks
        import oneflow as flow

        p = flow.placement.all("cuda") # oneflow.placement(type="cuda", ranks=[0, 1, 2, 3])

oneflow.sbp.sbp.__doc__ = r"""
    A ``oneflow.sbp`` is an object representing that how the data of the global tensor is distributed across the ranks of the ``Tensor`` placement.

    ``oneflow.sbp`` includes three types:

        - oneflow.sbp.split(dim)

          Indicates that the global tensor is evenly divided according to the dimension `dim` and distributed on each rank.

        - oneflow.sbp.broadcast()

          Indicates that the global tensor is replicated on each rank.

        - oneflow.sbp.partial_sum()

          Indicates that the value of the global tensor is element-wise sum of the local tensors distributed in each rank.


    A :class:`oneflow.Tensor`'s sbp can be accessed via the Tensor.sbp property.

    A ``oneflow.sbp`` can be constructed in several ways:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow

        >>> s = flow.sbp.split(0)
        >>> s
        oneflow.sbp.split(dim=0)
