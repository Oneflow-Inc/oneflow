    oneflow.amax(input, dim=None, keepdim=False) -> Tensor

    Returns the maximum along a dimension.

    This function is equivalent to PyTorchâ€™s amax function. 

    Args:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): the input Tensor.
        dim (int or List of int, optional): the dimension or the dimensions to reduce. Dim is None by default. 
        keepdim (bool, optional): whether to retain the dimension. keepdim is False by default. 

    Returns:
        oneflow.Tensor: Maximum of the input tensor

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> import oneflow as flow
               
        >>> x = flow.tensor([[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]])
        >>> flow.amax(x, 1)
        tensor([[2, 3],
                [6, 7]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.amax(x, 0)
        tensor([[4, 5],
                [6, 7]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.amax(x)
        tensor(7, dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.amax(x, 0, True)
        tensor([[[4, 5],
                 [6, 7]]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
    """,
