    swapdims(input, dim0, dim1) -> Tensor

    This function is equivalent to torchâ€™s swapdims function.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> import oneflow as flow

        >>> x = flow.tensor([[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]])
        >>> x
        tensor([[[0, 1],
                 [2, 3]],
        <BLANKLINE>
                [[4, 5],
                 [6, 7]]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> flow.swapdims(x, 0, 1)
        tensor([[[0, 1],
                 [4, 5]],
        <BLANKLINE>
                [[2, 3],
                 [6, 7]]], dtype=oneflow.int64)
