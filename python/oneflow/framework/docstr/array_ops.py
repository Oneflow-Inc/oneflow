    If input is a vector (1-D tensor), then returns a 2-D square tensor with the elements of input as the diagonal.
    If input is a matrix (2-D tensor), then returns a 1-D tensor with diagonal elements of input.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor.
        diagonal (Optional[int], 0): The diagonal to consider. 
            If diagonal = 0, it is the main diagonal. If diagonal > 0, it is above the main diagonal. If diagonal < 0, it is below the main diagonal. Defaults to 0.
    
    Returns:
        oneflow.Tensor: the output Tensor.
