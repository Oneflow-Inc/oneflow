    If input is a vector (1-D tensor), then returns a 2-D square tensor with the elements of input as the diagonal.
    If input is a matrix (2-D tensor), then returns a 1-D tensor with diagonal elements of input.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor.
        diagonal (Optional[int], 0): The diagonal to consider. 
            If diagonal = 0, it is the main diagonal. If diagonal > 0, it is above the main diagonal. If diagonal < 0, it is below the main diagonal. Defaults to 0.
    
    Returns:
        oneflow.Tensor: the output Tensor.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> arr = np.array(
        ...     [
        ...        [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        ...        [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
        ...        [7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
        ...     ]
        ... )

        >>> input = flow.Tensor(arr, dtype=flow.float32)
        >>> flow.diag(input)
        tensor([1., 5., 9.], dtype=oneflow.float32)
