    tile(input, dims) -> Tensor

    Constructs a tensor by repeating the elements of ``input``.  The ``dims`` argument specifies the number
    of repetitions in each dimension.

    If ``dims`` specifies fewer dimensions than ``input`` has, then ones are prepended to ``dims`` until
    all dimensions are specified.  For example, if ``input`` has shape (8, 6, 4, 2) and ``dims`` is (2, 2),
    then ``dims`` is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2).

    Analogously, if ``input`` has fewer dimensions than ``dims`` specifies, then ``input`` is treated as
    if it were unsqueezed at dimension zero until it has as many dimensions as ``dims`` specifies.
    For example, if ``input`` has shape (4, 2) and ``dims`` is (3, 3, 2, 2), then ``input`` is treated as
    if it had the shape (1, 1, 4, 2).

    .. note::
        This function is similar to NumPyâ€™s tile function.
    
    The interface is consistent with PyTorch.
    The documentation is referenced from:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/1.10/generated/torch.tile.html.

    Args:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): the tensor whose elements to repeat.
        dims (tuple): the number of repetitions per dimension.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        
        >>> np_arr = np.random.randn(5, 3, 6, 9).astype(np.float32)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(np_arr)
        >>> out = input.tile(2,1,2,1)
        >>> out.shape
        oneflow.Size([10, 3, 12, 9])
        >>> x = np.random.randn(5, 2, 1)
        >>> input = flow.Tensor(x)
        >>> out = input.tile(3,4)
        >>> out.shape
        oneflow.Size([5, 6, 4])
