    as_tensor(data, dtype=None, device=None) -> Tensor
    
    Converts data into a tensor, sharing data and preserving autograd history if possible.

    If data is already a tensor with the requeseted dtype and device then data itself is returned, but if data is a tensor with a different dtype or device then itâ€™s copied as if using data.to(dtype=dtype, device=device).

    If data is a NumPy array (an ndarray) with the same dtype and device then a tensor is constructed using oneflow.from_numpy.
    
    The interface is consistent with PyTorch.

    Args:
        data (array_like): Initial data for the tensor. Can be a list, tuple, NumPy ``ndarray``, scalar, and other types.
        dtype (oneflow.dtype, optional): the desired data type of returned tensor. Default: if ``None``, infers data type from data.
        device (oneflow.device, optional): the device of the constructed tensor. If ``None`` and data is a tensor then the device of data is used. If None and data is not a tensor then the result tensor is constructed on the CPU.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np
        
        >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        >>> t = flow.as_tensor(a, device=flow.device('cuda'))
        >>> t
        tensor([1, 2, 3], device='cuda:0', dtype=oneflow.int64)
        >>> t[0] = -1
        >>> a
        array([1, 2, 3])
