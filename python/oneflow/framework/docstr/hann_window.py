    hann_window(window_length, periodic=True, *, device=None,  placement=None, sbp=None, dtype=None, requires_grad=False) -> Tensor

    This function is equivalent to PyTorchâ€™s hann_window function. 
    The documentation is referenced from: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.10/generated/torch.hann_window.html.

    Hann window function.

    .. math::
        w[n] = \frac{1}{2}\ \left[1 - \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{N - 1} \right)\right] =
                \sin^2 \left( \frac{\pi n}{N - 1} \right),

    where :math:`N` is the full window size.

    The input :attr:`window_length` is a positive integer controlling the
    returned window size. :attr:`periodic` flag determines whether the returned
    window trims off the last duplicate value from the symmetric window. Therefore, if :attr:`periodic` is true, the :math:`N` in
    above formula is in fact :math:`\text{window_length} + 1`. Also, we always have
    ``oneflow.hann_window(L, periodic=True)`` equal to
    ``oneflow.hann_window(L + 1, periodic=False)[:-1])``.

    .. note::
        If :attr:`window_length` :math:`=1`, the returned window contains a single value 1.

    Arguments:
        window_length (int): the size of returned window
        periodic (bool, optional): If True, returns a window to be used as periodic
            function. If False, return a symmetric window.

    Keyword args:
        dtype (oneflow.dtype, optional): the data type to perform the computation in.
            Default: if None, uses the global default dtype (see oneflow.get_default_dtype())
            when both :attr:`start` and :attr:`end` are real,
            and corresponding complex dtype when either is complex.
        device (oneflow.device, optional): the desired device of returned tensor. Default: if None, uses the current device for the default tensor type
        placement (oneflow.placement, optional): the desired placement of returned global tensor. Default: if None, the returned tensor is local one using the argument `device`.
        sbp (oneflow.sbp.sbp or tuple of oneflow.sbp.sbp, optional): the desired sbp descriptor of returned global tensor. Default: if None, the returned tensor is local one using the argument `device`.
        requires_grad (bool, optional): If autograd should record operations on the returned tensor. Default: False.

    Returns:
        Tensor: A 1-D tensor of size :math:`(\text{{window_length}},)` containing the window
