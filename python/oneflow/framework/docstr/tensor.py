add_docstr(
    oneflow.tensor,
    r"""
    Constructs a tensor with data, return a consistent tensor if placement and sbp are in kwargs,
       otherwise return a local tensor. 
       
    Arguments:
        data: Initial data for the tensor. Can be a list, tuple, NumPy ndarray, scalar or tensor.
    Keyword Arguments:
        dtype (oneflow.dtype, optional) â€“ the desired data type of returned tensor.
            Default: if None, infers data type from data.
        device (oneflow.device, optional): the desired device of returned tensor. If placement
            and sbp is None, uses the current cpu for the default tensor type.
        placement (oneflow.placement, optional): the desired placement of returned tensor.
        sbp (oneflow.sbp or tuple of oneflow.sbp, optional): the desired sbp of returned tensor.
        requires_grad (bool, optional): If autograd should record operations on the returned tensor. Default: False

    Noted:
        The Keyword Argument device is mutually exclusive with placement and sbp.
        Consistent tensor only can be constructed from tensor.


    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        
        >>> x = flow.tensor([1,2,3])
        >>> x
        tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=oneflow.int64)

    """,
