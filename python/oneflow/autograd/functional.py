def vjp(func, inputs, v=None, create_graph=False, strict=False):
    r"""Compute the dot product between a vector ``v`` and the Jacobian of the given function at the point given by the inputs.

    The documentation is referenced from: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.autograd.functional.vjp.html

    Args:
        func (function): a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns
            a tuple of Tensors or a Tensor.
        inputs (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): inputs to the function ``func``.
        v (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): The vector for which the vector
            Jacobian product is computed.  Must be the same size as the output
            of ``func``. This argument is optional when the output of ``func``
            contains a single element and (if it is not provided) will be set
            as a Tensor containing a single ``1``.
        create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, both the output and result
            will be computed in a differentiable way. Note that when ``strict``
            is ``False``, the result can not require gradients or be
            disconnected from the inputs.  Defaults to ``False``.
        strict (bool, optional): If ``True``, an error will be raised when we
            detect that there exists an input such that all the outputs are
            independent of it. If ``False``, we return a Tensor of zeros as the
            vjp for said inputs, which is the expected mathematical value.
            Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns:
        output (tuple): tuple with:
            func_output (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): output of ``func(inputs)``

            vjp (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): result of the dot product with
            the same shape as the inputs.
