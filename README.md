[![Simple CI](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow/actions/workflows/simple.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow/actions/workflows/simple.yml)

## Install OneFlow

  ### System Requirements

  - Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
  - CUDA Toolkit Linux x86_64 Driver

    - CUDA runtime is statically linked into OneFlow. OneFlow will work on a minimum supported driver, and any driver beyond. For more information, please refer to [CUDA compatibility documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).

    - Please upgrade your Nvidia driver to version 440.33 or above and install OneFlow for CUDA 10.2 if possible.

  ### Install with Pip Package

  - To install latest stable release of OneFlow with CUDA support:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -f https://release.oneflow.info oneflow==0.4.0+cu102 --user
    ```

  - To install nightly release of OneFlow with CUDA support:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install oneflow --user -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/master/cu102
    ```

  - To install other available builds for different variants:
    - Stable
      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install --find-links https://release.oneflow.info oneflow==0.4.0+[PLATFORM] --user
      ```
    - Nightly
      ```
      python3 -m pip install oneflow --user -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/master/[PLATFORM]
      ```
    - All available `[PLATFORM]`:
      | Platform |CUDA Driver Version| Supported GPUs |
      |---|---|---|
      | cu112  | >= 450.80.02  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx, A100, RTX 30xx |
      | cu111  | >= 450.80.02  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx, A100, RTX 30xx |
      | cu110, cu110_xla  | >= 450.36.06  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx, A100|
      | cu102, cu102_xla  | >= 440.33  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx |
      | cu101, cu101_xla  | >= 418.39  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx |
      | cu100, cu100_xla  | >= 410.48  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx |
      | cpu  | N/A | N/A |

  - If you are in China, you could run this to have pip download packages from domestic mirror of pypi:
    ```
    python3 -m pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
    ```
    For more information on this, please refer to [pypi 镜像使用帮助](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/)

### Build from Source
<details>
<summary>Clone Source Code</summary>

- #### Option 1: Clone source code from GitHub

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow --depth=1
  ```

- #### Option 2: Download from Aliyun

  If you are in China, please download OneFlow source code from: https://oneflow-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow-src.zip

  ```bash
  curl https://oneflow-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow-src.zip -o oneflow-src.zip
  unzip oneflow-src.zip
  ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build OneFlow</summary>

- #### Option 1: Build with Conda (recommended)
  Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/conda-env)

- #### Option 2: Build in docker container (recommended)
  - In the root directory of OneFlow source code, run:

    ```
    python3 docker/package/manylinux/build_wheel.py
    ```

    This should produce `.whl` files in the directory `wheelhouse`

  - If you are in China, you might need to add these flags:

    ```
    --use_tuna --use_system_proxy --use_aliyun_mirror
    ```

  - You can choose CUDA/Python versions of wheel by adding:

    ```
    --cuda_version=10.1 --python_version=3.6,3.7
    ```

  - For more useful flags, plese run the script with flag `--help` or refer to the source code of the script.

- #### Option 3: Build on bare metal
  - Install dependencies. For instance, on Ubuntu 20.04, run:
    ```
    sudo apt install -y libmkl-full-dev nasm libc++-11-dev libncurses5 g++ gcc cmake gdb python3-pip
    ```
    If there is a prompt, it is recommended to select the option to make mkl the default BLAS library.
  - In the root directory of OneFlow source code, run:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```

  - Add oneflow to your PYTHONPATH

    ```
    source build/source.sh
    ```

    Please note that this change is not permanent.

  - Simple validation

    ```
    python3 -m oneflow --doctor
    ```

  - If you are in China, please add these CMake flags `-DTHIRD_PARTY_MIRROR=aliyun -DPIP_INDEX_MIRROR=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` for faster dependency downloads.
  - For pure CPU build, please add this CMake flag `-DBUILD_CUDA=OFF`.
