## Install OneFlow

  ### System Requirements

  - Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 (3.9 is available in nightly version)
  - (**Highly recommended**) Upgrade pip

    ```
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip #--user
    ```

  - CUDA Toolkit Linux x86_64 Driver

    - CUDA runtime is statically linked into OneFlow. OneFlow will work on a minimum supported driver, and any driver beyond. For more information, please refer to [CUDA compatibility documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).

    - Please upgrade your Nvidia driver to version 440.33 or above and install OneFlow for CUDA 10.2 if possible.

  ### Install with Pip Package

  - To install latest stable release of OneFlow with CUDA support:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -f https://release.oneflow.info oneflow==0.4.0+cu102
    ```

  - To install nightly release of OneFlow with CUDA support:
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install oneflow -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/master/cu102
    ```

  - To install other available builds for different variants:
    - Stable
      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install --find-links https://release.oneflow.info oneflow==0.4.0+[PLATFORM]
      ```
    - Nightly
      ```
      python3 -m pip install oneflow -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/master/[PLATFORM]
      ```
    - All available `[PLATFORM]`:
      | Platform |CUDA Driver Version| Supported GPUs |
      |---|---|---|
      | cu112  | >= 450.80.02  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx, A100, RTX 30xx |

      | cu100, cu100_xla  | >= 410.48  | GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx |
      | cpu  | N/A | N/A |

  - If you are in China, you could run this to have pip download packages from domestic mirror of pypi:
    ```
    python3 -m pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
    ```
    For more information on this, please refer to [pypi 镜像使用帮助](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/)

### Build from Source
<details>
<summary>Clone Source Code</summary>

- #### Option 1: Clone source code from GitHub

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow --depth=1
  ```

- #### Option 2: Download from Aliyun

  If you are in China, please download OneFlow source code from: https://oneflow-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow-src.zip

  ```bash
  curl https://oneflow-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow-src.zip -o oneflow-src.zip
  unzip oneflow-src.zip
  ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build OneFlow</summary>

- #### Option 1: Build with Conda (recommended)
  Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/conda-env)

- #### Option 2: Build in docker container (recommended)
  - Pull a docker image:

    ```
    docker pull oneflowinc/oneflow-manylinux2014-cuda10.2:0.1
    ```

    All images available : https://hub.docker.com/u/oneflowinc

  - In the root directory of OneFlow source code, run:

    ```
    python3 docker/package/manylinux/build_wheel.py --python_version=3.6
    ```

    This should produce `.whl` files in the directory `wheelhouse`

  - If you are in China, you might need to add these flags:

    ```
    --use_tuna --use_system_proxy --use_aliyun_mirror
    ```

  - You can choose CUDA/Python versions of wheel by adding:

    ```
    --cuda_version=10.1 --python_version=3.6,3.7
    ```

  - For more useful flags, plese run the script with flag `--help` or refer to the source code of the script.

- #### Option 3: Build on bare metal
  - Install dependencies
    - on Ubuntu 20.04, run:
      ```
      sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev nasm g++ gcc python3-pip cmake autoconf libtool
      ```
    - on macOS, run:
      ```
      brew install nasm
      ```
  - In the root directory of OneFlow source code, run:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

  - Config the project, inside `build` directory:
    - If you are in China

      run this to config for CUDA:
      ```
      cmake .. -C ../cmake/caches/cn/cuda.cmake
      ```

      run this to config for CPU-only:
      ```
      cmake .. -C ../cmake/caches/cn/cpu.cmake
      ```

    - If you are not in China

      run this to config for CUDA:
      ```
      cmake .. -C ../cmake/caches/international/cuda.cmake
      ```

      run this to config for CPU-only:
      ```
      cmake .. -C ../cmake/caches/international/cpu.cmake
      ```

  - Build the project, inside `build` directory, run:
    ```
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```

  - Add oneflow to your PYTHONPATH, inside `build` directory, run:

    ```
    source source.sh
    ```

    Please note that this change is not permanent.

  - Simple validation

    ```
    python3 -m oneflow --doctor
    ```
