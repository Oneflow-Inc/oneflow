## Install OneFlow

  ### System Requirements

  - Python >= 3.5
  - CUDA Toolkit Linux x86_64 Driver
    | OneFlow |CUDA Driver Version|
    |---|---|
    | oneflow_cu110  | >= 450.36.06  |
    | oneflow_cu102  | >= 440.33  |
    | oneflow_cu101  | >= 418.39  |
    | oneflow_cu100  | >= 410.48  |
    | oneflow_cu92  | >= 396.26  |
    | oneflow_cu91  | >= 390.46  |
    | oneflow_cu90  | >= 384.81  |
    | oneflow_cpu  | N/A  |

    - CUDA runtime is statically linked into OneFlow. OneFlow will work on a minimum supported driver, and any driver beyond. For more information, please refer to [CUDA compatibility documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).

    - Support for latest stable version of CUDA will be prioritized. Please upgrade your Nvidia driver to version 440.33 or above and install `oneflow_cu102` if possible.

    - We are sorry that due to limits on bandwidth and other resources, we could only guarantee the efficiency and stability of `oneflow_cu102`. We will improve it ASAP.

  ### Install with Pip Package

  - To install latest release of OneFlow with CUDA support:

    ```
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cu102 --user
    ```

  - To install latest release of CPU-only OneFlow:

    ```
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cpu --user
    ```

  - To install OneFlow with legacy CUDA support, run one of:
    ```
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cu101 --user
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cu100 --user
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cu92 --user
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cu91 --user
    python3 -m pip install --find-links https://oneflow-inc.github.io/nightly oneflow_cu90 --user
    ```

  - If you are in China, you could run this to have pip download packages from domestic mirror of pypi:
    ```
    python3 -m pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
    ```
    For more information on this, please refer to [pypi 镜像使用帮助](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/)

  - Releases are built with G++/GCC 4.8.5, cuDNN 7 and MKL 2020.0-088.

### Build from Source

1. #### System Requirements to Build OneFlow

    - Please use a newer version of CMake to build OneFlow. You could download cmake release from [here](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.14.0/cmake-3.14.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz).

    - Please make sure you have G++ and GCC >= 4.8.5 installed. Clang is not supported for now.

    - To install dependencies, run:

      ```
      yum-config-manager --add-repo https://yum.repos.intel.com/setup/intelproducts.repo && \
      rpm --import https://yum.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS-2019.PUB && \
      yum update -y && yum install -y epel-release && \
      yum install -y intel-mkl-64bit-2020.0-088 nasm swig rdma-core-devel
      ```

      On CentOS, if you have MKL installed, please update the environment variable:

      ```
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/lib/intel64_lin:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      ```

      If you don't want to build OneFlow with MKL, you could install OpenBLAS.
      On CentOS:
      ```
      sudo yum -y install openblas-devel
      ```
      On Ubuntu:
      ```
      sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev
      ```

2. #### Clone Source Code

    - #### Option 1: Clone source code from github

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow
      ```

    - #### Option 2: Download from Aliyun

      If you are in China, please download OneFlow source code from: https://oneflow-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow-src.zip

      ```bash
      curl https://oneflow-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow-src.zip -o oneflow-src.zip
      unzip oneflow-src.zip
      ```

3. #### Build and Install OneFlow

    - #### Option 1: Build in docker container (recommended)
      - In the root directory of OneFlow source code, run:

        ```
        python3 docker/package/manylinux/build_wheel.py
        ```

        This should produces `.whl` files in the directory `wheelhouse`

      - If you are in China, you might need to add these flags:

        ```
        --use_tuna --use_system_proxy --use_aliyun_mirror
        ```

      - You can choose CUDA/Python versions of wheel by adding:

        ```
        --cuda_version=10.1 --python_version=3.6,3.7
        ```

      - For more useful flags, plese run the script with flag `--help` or refer to the source code of the script.

    - #### Option 2: Build on bare metal
      - In the root directory of OneFlow source code, run:

        ```
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make -j$(nproc)
        make pip_install
        ```

      - If you are in China, please add this CMake flag `-DTHIRD_PARTY_MIRROR=aliyun` to speed up the downloading procedure for some dependency tar files.
      - For pure CPU build, please add this CMake flag `-DBUILD_CUDA=OFF`.

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to [troubleshooting](docs/source/troubleshooting.md) for common issues you might encounter when compiling and running OneFlow.

### Advanced features

- #### XRT

  You can check this [doc](oneflow/xrt/README.md) to obtain more details about how to use XLA and TensorRT with OneFlow.
