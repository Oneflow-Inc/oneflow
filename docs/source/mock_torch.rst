oneflow.mock_torch
===================================

OneFlow's API is aligned with PyTorch, and users can easily migrate PyTorch models to OneFlow using the `mock_torch` module.

We provide a more fine-grained mock function, so that users can control whether or not a piece of code is mock-enabled 

Detailed usage can be found in the tutorial https://docs.oneflow.org/master/cookies/oneflow_torch.html#3-oneflow
