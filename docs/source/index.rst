OneFlow API Reference
===================================


Distributed performance (high efficiency) is the core technical difficulty of deep learning frameworks. 

OneFlow upholds the core concept and architecture of static compilation and streaming parallelism around performance improvement and heterogeneous distributed scaling, solving the challenge of memory wall at cluster level with world-leading technology.
